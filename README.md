# helpdesk-helper

Wanted to work on a project which would not only sharpen my Python skills, but also something I might be able to use for my Helpdesk job.

This essentially is a shell app that prompts the technician which of a handful of diagnostic tests or utilites they want to run on a Windows-based machine.
